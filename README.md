**Problem Statement:**
In modern agriculture, sorting and quickly identifying different fruits and vegetables is essential during the harvesting process. Manual sorting takes a lot of time, is prone to mistakes, and can cause supply chain inefficiencies.
The primary goal of my proposed project is to automate the manual sorting of fruits and vegetables during the harvest, aiming to rectify the inefficiencies and inaccuracies associated with the current manual identification and sorting methods in agriculture. The automation of this process is important to increase efficiency, minimize losses, and improve the overall quality of produce delivered to consumers.

**Business Value:**
The solution targets farmers, distributors, and retailers in the agricultural field. By implementing a fruit and vegetable recognition system, users can streamline their operations, reduce labor costs, minimize waste through accurate sorting, and ensure a consistent quality of products. This boosts productivity and improves the reputation of the agricultural supply chain that leads to the increased customer satisfaction.

**Solution Strategy:**

**1.	Data Collection:**

I collected data by recording videos of various fruits and vegetables. Then used the video to image converter to retrieve the images for training and testing datasets. Also, downloaded images from google for the prediction process in the real time.

**2.	Pre-trained Model Selection:**

In the process of developing this project, the selection of a pre-trained model plays an important role in ensuring accurate and efficient predictions. The target is to choose a pre-trained CNN model that excels in image recognition. I chose Resnet 50 model based on their usage in the similar tasks.

**3.	Downstream Processing:**

•	Currently, my intention is to incorporate the model into a web application that can be easily integrated as a component of the precision agricultural system.
•	We can further embed the automated sorting system into harvesting machinery, such as combine harvesters or robotic harvesters, allowing for on-the-go sorting during the harvesting process for the future use.
